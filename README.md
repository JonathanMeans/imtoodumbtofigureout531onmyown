# CI/CD
On every push, tests are run on [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/github/JonathanMeans/imtoodumbtofigureout531onmyown) and coverage is reported on [CodeCov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/JonathanMeans/imtoodumbtofigureout531onmyown). 
Currently, only coverage for the Python code is measured. The build fails if coverage is less than 95%.
